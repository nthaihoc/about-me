## About Me

"Hello, my name is Thai-Hoc Nguyen, and I am an Artificial Intelligence researcher. While I began my studies in Data Science & AI at the University of Information and Communication Technology (ICTU) in 2020, my true passion for AI fully ignited when I joined the Institute of Applied Science and Technology (IAST) in August 2024 as a Computer Vision Intern.

At IAST, I strengthened my foundational knowledge while directly contributing to AI applications in healthcare, education, and speech processing. My current research focuses on developing practical Machine Learning and Computer Vision solutions, including speech recognition, to improve medical diagnostics, patient care, and online education experiences.

I aim to leverage AI to create impactful, real-world solutions that bridge research and application. For more information, feel free to view my [curriculum_vitae](https://) or contact me directly at [thaihoc.it02@gmail.com](mailto:thaihoc.it02@gmail.com)."

## Research Interests

My research focuses on advancing practical and cutting-edge AI solutions across multiple domains:

* **Machine Learning.** Exploring algorithms and optimization techniques, with emphasis on data collection, preprocessing, and practical deployment.

* **Deep Learning.** Developing deep learning models for healthcare applications, 3D image processing, autonomous vehicles, manufacturing, and advanced image analysis.

* **Big Data.** Building scalable big data processing pipelines and applications using Hadoop and Spark.

* **Large Language Models (LLMs) & Vision-Language Models (VLMs).** Researching model development, optimization, and application in natural language understanding, generation, and multimodal tasks to enhance real-world AI solutions.

* **AI Operations (MLOps/DLOps/LLMOps).** Optimizing the workflow, deployment, and maintenance of AI models in production.

Additionally, I have a strong interest in exploring advanced AI techniques, including 3D vision, autonomous driving systems, and large-scale data analytics, aiming to bridge research and impactful applications.
